## <a id='how-to-upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

The [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) topic contains instructions for upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>.


## <a id='releases'></a> Releases

### <a id="2-8-0-alpha-2"></a> 2.8.0 Alpha 2

* **[Feature]** Operators can use NSX-T with Principal Identity certificate authentication
* **[Feature]** `zero_if` optionally lets operators choose an instance count of `0` when the `zero_if` condition is not active and the `allow_manual_selection_of_zero` is set to  `true`
* **[Feature]** Tile authors can add optional dependencies to a tile. The existing top-level key `requires_product_versions` has an `optional` key for each listed product.
* **[Feature]** Provides new accessors for Telemetry: IaaS type and Director GUID
* **[Feature]** Tile authors can define an install time verifier to run a HTTP/s request
* **[Feature]** Updates BOSH DNS runtime config and example runtime config to have properties at the job level instead of the addon level. This is a requirement of the newer BOSH version used by Ops Manager. Other product that use runtime configs must update as well.
* **[Feature]**  Begins consuming credhub-release from the Pivotal CredHub LTS repo to ensure users will be able to consume patches
* **[Feature]** The Telemetry tile is available in the sidebar by default 
* **[Feature]** Operators can visually distinguish the required and optional dependencies of a given product on the _Review Pending Changes_ page
* **[Feature]** API shows which dependencies are optional and their status
* **[Feature]** Tile authors can declare default values based on optional dependencies to shape the default configuration of products
* **[Bug Fix]** Ops Manager API shows deployed certificates when only the BOSH Director has been deployed

### <a id="2-8-0-alpha-1"></a> 2.8.0 Alpha 1

* **[Feature]** Bulk Rotation of Certificates in CredHub. 
	* The Ops Manager API for rotating certificate authorities and leaf certificates now also rotates certificate authorities and leaf certificates stored in CredHub. For more information about rotating certificates using the Ops Manager API, see [Rotating Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).
* **[Feature]** Tile developers can specify static values for verifier properties. 
	* The properties of a form or install time verifier can now be specified as a static value, in addition to being a reference to a tile or job property.
* **[Feature]** Tile developers can implement an install time HTTP verifier
	* There may be conditions that a tile developer deems it unsafe for an operator to start a deployment. A new install time verifier is available that can make requests to a specified HTTP endpoint, and prevents the deployment if the response is not successful. Tile developers can also specify that the verifier should only run on major or minor upgrades. 
* **[Feature]** Removes tracking and verification of the BOSH DNS CA, as this responsibility is now handled by maestro. Specifically, this update removes the following:
	* The `deployed_product_certificate_versions` table in the Ops Manager database
	* The `CertificateRotationVerifier` verifier 
* **[Feature]** Operators can back up the Director UAA database with BBR
* **[Feature]** Tile authors can add optional dependencies to a tile using the `optional` key under `requires_product_versions`
* **[Feature]** Tile authors can check if an optional dependency is present using the `.present?` accessor  
* **[Feature]** Upgrades to maestro v3
* **[Feature]** Upgrades to Node v12
* **[Feature]** Upgrades to Capybara v3.28.0

## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='om-api-rotate-credhub-certs'></a> Ops Manager API Rotates CredHub Certificates and Certificate Authorities

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This feature causes a breaking change. For more information, see <a href="./breaking-changes.html#credhub-generated-field">Reset Manually Set Certificates in CredHub Before Upgrade</a>.</p>

When you rotate certificate authorities and leaf certificates using the `certificate_authorities/active/regenerate` Ops Manager API endpoint, the API includes certificate authorities and leaf certificates stored in CredHub.

For more information about rotating certificates using the Ops Manager API, see [Rotating Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html). For more information about the `certificate_authorities/active/regenerate` endpoint, see [Rotate Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsman-api/#create-root-certificate-authorities) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id='maestro-rotate-ca'></a> Maestro Rotates BOSH DNS Certificate Authorities

Maestro rotates BOSH DNS CAs and runs safety checks.

Maestro is a service for configuring and managing the infrastructure that serves and supports containerized apps. For more information about Maestro, see the [Maestro documentation](https://maestro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).

### <a id='opsman-metrics'></a> All Platform VMs Emit System Metrics

The `runtime_config` code in Ops Manager v2.8 installs a system metrics agent on all Pivotal Platform VMs.
This lets [Pivotal Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch), [Pivotal App Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/app-metrics) and other platform tools consume VM metrics from PAS, PKS, hosted services, and any other products deployed by Ops Manager.

System metrics report usage and status of VM memory, disk, CPU, network, load, and swap space.
See a complete list of metrics in the [`system-metrics-release` repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/system-metrics-release/blob/develop/docs/system-metrics-agent.md#vm-metrics).

Before Ops Manager v2.8, the metrics agent was installed only on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) VMs, and VMs deployed by other products did not emit the system metrics described above.
